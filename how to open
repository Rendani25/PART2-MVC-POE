How to Open Your Project in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio:

Open Visual Studio on your computer.
Open Your Project:

Click on File in the top menu.
Select Open > Project/Solution....
Navigate to the folder where your project is located (e.g., C:\Users\RC_Student_lab\Videos\PART2 MVC POE\).
Select the .sln (solution) file and click Open.
Find the HomeController:

In the Solution Explorer on the right side of Visual Studio, expand the project nodes to find your Controllers folder.
Double-click on HomeController.cs to open it in the editor.
Locate the Error:

Scroll to line 121, or search for the specific code line that is causing the error (you can use Ctrl + G to go to a specific line number).
Identify the line that tries to assign the list of FileCreations to SystemFiles.
Modify the Code:

Implement the mapping code I provided in the previous messages.
Save your changes by clicking File > Save or using the shortcut Ctrl + S.
Build the Project:

After making changes, itâ€™s good practice to build your project to check for errors.
Click on Build in the top menu and then select Build Solution (or press Ctrl + Shift + B).
Check the Error List window to see if the error has been resolved.
Run the Application:

To test the changes, you can run the application by clicking the Start button (green play button) or pressing F5.
Navigate to the upload page in your application to see if it works as expected.
